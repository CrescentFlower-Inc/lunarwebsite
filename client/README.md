# Lunarian Federation Client

# Configuration
In src/config.jsx, you can configure the behaviour of the client.
This is used when developing the client and server at the same time.
See the comments for more information.

# Starting server
You can start up the dev server with ```
$ npm run dev
OR
$ pnpm run dev
```

You can compile for prod with ```
$ npm run build
OR
$ pnpm run build
# This gets served at the server
```
